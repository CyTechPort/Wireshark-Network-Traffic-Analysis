### Cybersecurity Portfolio Project: Network Traffic Capture Using Wireshark

#### Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze network traffic using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer. I captured and examined packets to identify patterns, potential security threats, and performance issues within a network.

#### Features
- Captured real-time network traffic for analysis.
- Filtered packets based on protocols, IP addresses, and ports.
- Analyzed traffic patterns to detect anomalies or suspicious activity.
- Generated visual graphs and statistics to summarize findings.

#### Prerequisites
Before starting, I ensured I had the following:
- **Wireshark**: Downloaded and installed from [Wireshark's official site](https://www.wireshark.org/).
- **Network Access**: Gained administrator or root access to capture traffic on the desired network.
- **Basic Networking Knowledge**: Familiarized myself with networking concepts, protocols, and packet structures.

#### Installation
1. **Wireshark Download**:
   - Downloaded Wireshark from [Wireshark Downloads](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
   - Followed the installation instructions for my operating system.

#### Capture Setup
1. **Wireshark Launch**:
   - Opened Wireshark and selected the network interface I wished to monitor (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

2. **Started Capturing**:
   - Clicked the "Start capturing packets" button (the shark fin icon) and captured network traffic for a predetermined period.

3. **Stopped Capturing**:
   - Clicked the "Stop capturing packets" button after sufficient data was collected.

#### Traffic Analysis
1. **Applied Filters**:
   - Used display filters to narrow down the captured traffic, such as `http` for HTTP traffic and `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1` for packets from a specific IP.

2. **Analyzed Protocols**:
   - Examined common protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) and identified any unusual patterns or anomalies, such as excessive retransmissions.

3. **Generated Statistics**:
   - Accessed the "Statistics" menu to view summaries, including Protocol Hierarchy and I/O Graphs.
